<li><strong>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</strong></li>
	<p>My long term goal is to be proficient at coding and integrate it into my full-time job. I was reading through the blog post submissions and found the above as a recurring pattern. There are always tech improvements and resources that makes life easier for the user and the organisation as a whole. Maybe due to limitations, funding or other factors, alot of these concerns or issues within the workplace go unexplored and left to stagnate </p>

	<p>Currently working within the banking and finance industry; there is an exceedingly high demand for automation mainly due to volume vs time concerns. My role is directly related to lending applications and the sheer number is often overwhelming.</p>

	<p>It is disappointing to realise that the software and applications being used till date is actually 20+ years old and often out-dated.</p>

	<p>In a sudden moment of clarity, I understood that coding and programming will alleviate the daily struggles of being a banker under pressure. Additionally, it would save the company a lot of time and money. Moreso, I consider myself a student forever and Dev-Academy has now paved the way to my success.

<li><strong>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</strong></li>
	<p>I would liking working within a team. Developing a bond with my peers is also high on my list. </p>

	<p>Perhaps working with someone who has experience in the industry or has a higher skill-set would be great. That way I can relate more and have a go-to to answer questions and to also work on a project together.</p>

	<p>At times, I'm socially anxious and a bit timid but I warm up quickly. I may have some starting trouble when communicating but I tend to adjust well, given time.

<li><strong>A description of your own strengths and limitations</strong></li>
	<p>Strengths - Hard-working, Diligent, Punctual. I like to strategize and think critically and creatively.</p>
	<p>Weakness - Social anxiety, time-management needs to be improved and asking for help.</p></li>

	<p><strong>My pledge</strong></p>

	<p><em>I'll strive to work to the best of my ability and learn as much as possible. I'll make sure to work on my communication and reach out to facilitators and fellow students. Follow techniques and time-keeping methods to understand my potential and be productive.</p>

	<p>Ultimately, I'd like to be in a position to contribute to my work, family and community as a whole. To be an upstanding person who helps society.</em></p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>What is Emotional Intelligence</strong></li>
            
            <p>Emotional intelligence refers to how a person identifies and controls one's own emotions, as well as how they perceive the emotions of other people. It is measured numerically and represented as the EQ or emotional quotient.</p>
            
            <li><strong>How is it different to IQ?</strong></li>

            <p>IQ or Intelligence Quotient is a numerical score that measures a person's intellectual abilities such as memory, quantitative reasoning, visual and spatial processing etc. A person with a high IQ can work out the solution for a difficult mathematics problem, for instance. But that person may not necessarily have a high EQ.</p>

            <li><strong>Why is it important?</strong></li>

            <p>Emotional intelligence is important because it determines how a person relates to others. In other words how does one use their emotions for social communication and modulate those emotions based on those of others around them. In a workplace scenario, the dynamics of a team depends on each member's emotional intelligence. Every member must be able to look within themselves and identify if they are stressed so that measures can be taken to counter that, such as reducing workload by delegating tasks to others. They must also be able to engage with their teammates in an open, respectful and empathetic manner even when dealing with conflicting viewpoints.</p>

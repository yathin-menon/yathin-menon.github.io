	<ol>
        <li><strong>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</strong></li>
        <p>Neuroplasticity is the ability of the nervous system to change its activity in response to external or internal stimuli. </p>
    
        <p>By organizing or reorganizing certain attributes, the brain is able to adapt, evolve and grow. The neurons in our brain is able to model itself
		   to work or understand or perform more efficiently.
		
		</p>

		<p>Long story short, it is the ability to learn new things. It is to enhance one's existing cognitive capabilities</p>
    
        
    
    <li><strong>Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</strong></li>
        <p>Neuroplasticity will help me understand how things work that I have no previous experience with.</p>

		<p>I have to retrain my brain in order to learn new things quickly and by practicing constantly, it will help me solve issues or problem quicker</p>
          
                  
    <li><strong>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</strong></li>
        <p>Brain Training</p>
		<p>Aerobic excercises</p>
		<p>Social Contact</p>
        <p>Practicing mindfulness</p>

    <li><strong>Research Growth Mindset</strong></li>

    <p><em>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</em></p>

	<p>Research and growth mindset is essential when learning and understanding new things. It helps with ideas and gives us a better view and perspective on things to be prepared for</p>
	      
    <p><em>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</em></p> 
        
    <p>Not much to be surprised about. I took this course with a strong realisation that I'd have to learn new things that are foreign to me and I'd have to find efficient ways to digest the knowledge
	   in a short time.
	</p>
        
    <p><em>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</em></p>  

    <p>Being mindful and living in the present with a willingness and openness to learn and understand new topics and subjects courageously.</p>

        <li><strong>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</strong></li>

    <p>I have integrated the learning objectives and the cultural aspect of the foundation course to objectively learn and practice coding and programming to a degree where I'm proficient.</p>

	<p>Also have a better understanding of how to manage the workflow and the influx of information moving forward by researching and exploring while managing time.</p>

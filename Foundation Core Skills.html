<li><strong>Journal</strong></li>
	<p>What surprised me the most about learning core is that I was not aware how mindfulness and the skills I learned were so important.</p>

    <p>Also noted that these skills were not taught in schools or any other conventional universities or academic institutions. I was always under the impression that the core skills were 
       part of a more philosophical outlook and one gains a basic understanding as they go through the game of life.
    </p>
    <p>Thanks to EDA, I'm more self aware and mindful of myself and the environment I am in.</p>
    <p>Taking a break from work after toiling for 12+ hours a day and switching to studying full time is one of the best decisions I have made in life. Thanks to my partner's support,
       I'm able to move forward in life. Whether or not I get a job after study is not important to me because the journey through foundations has given me the confidence to look back to the past
       with wisdom, gaze into the future with an open mind and remain happy in the present state. 
    </p>
<li><strong>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</strong></li>
	<p>I'm liking pair programming and working within a team. Developing a bond with my peers has been a highlight.</p>

	<p>I now know to put my ego aside and focus on the tasks on hand and try to develop human skills and core skills simultaneously.</p>

	<p>Always value time and listen to people when they are talking. Don't try to talk over them. Be more appreciative of the opportunity</p>

<li><strong>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</strong></li>
	<p>Self-Awareness - You are aware of not just yourself but also the world around you. Every line you code is going to create a better world and a better future.</p>
	<p>Empathy - In order to make the world a better place, one needs to walk a mile in others' shoes. This is the right way to understand troubles, obstacles and the hardship
       faced by people across the globe. Empathy is very important when coding and programming.</p>
    <p>Valuese - Whatever values you have in life is very important when it comes to coding. Those positive and strong values needs to be used for the betterment of the human race</p></li>
<li><strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</strong></li>	
    <p>As mentioned in my journal above, I was a little skeptical about the direction the foundations camp was heading when we had to practice core skills and tech practice simultaneously.
       The core skills help you be aware of rest, taking a break, communicating with peers, understand your surroundings and be mindful about the present. It is something that is
       severely lacking in present day academic institutions.

    </p>    

<li><strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</strong></li>	
    <p>I now understand how important it is to at least be aware of core skills as it will contribute to learning. Coding and programming will only achieve its full potential through
       a mind that is positive and has the ability to think creatively and constructively to help the world become a better place. 
    </p>    

<li><strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong></li>
    <p>I can absolutely say with the utmost confidence that learning core skills has only boosted my resolve and given me direction. It has helped me tackle issues and roadblocks. I have 
       become a lot more calm and composed because of it.

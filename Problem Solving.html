        <li><strong>The Problem</strong></li>
        <p>The problem that I had was during the third Kata excercise where I had to work out the average
		   of the numbers.
		<p>It was hard for me to understand the unit test equation.</p>
		<p>I tried multiple ways of structuring the equation and spoke with one of my classmates to help.</p>
		<p>I started console logging to see how I could progress.</p>	
		<p>Contacted a facilitator but never received a reply. I then googled to explore a solution but once again
		   there were quite a few examples.
		   Finally, I was able to understand the examples and make my own equation to find the average.

    <li><strong>Problem Solving Techniques</strong></li>
		<p>Pseudocode: Confident but not very helpful</p>
		<p>Trying something: Master at trial and error</p>
        <p>Rubber Ducky: My partner thought I was crazy talking to an empty cans with holes for eyes</p>
		<p>Reading error messages: Helps with telling you what you already know</p>
		<p>Console.logging: Most effective way to test your coding</p>
		<p>Googling: End all to solutions</p>
		<p>Asking peers for help: They are busy, you are busy, everyone is busy. And they may be wrong.</p>
		<p>Asking coaches for help: Refer above except the wrong part.</p>
		<p>Improving your process with reflection: Yes, I guess this helps</p>
